It\u2019s almost as if the dungeon master just made the dungeon up at random. And so you wander about and you get what you get.\r\n\r\nBut you\u2019re also a developer. You could build a database of all the rooms with their shiny and monstrous content. Then you could query it and find the optimal route to get the gold and the experience and the levels. But how would you model this data and write these queries? The rooms. The corridors. The monsters. The sparkling hoozits. That\u2019s a lot of entities to relate to each other. And that\u2019s gonna be a monster of a SQL query. Whoa\u2013look at that JOIN! Better get my text editor ready.\r\n\r\nOr, you could use a graph database. A graph database allows you to model these relationships simply and intuitively with nodes and edges. Being schema-free, you can evolve your graph as you encounter new things such as traps or secret doors. And, using the Cypher query language, you can write elegant and easy to understand queries that find the best routes to get the stuff adventures desire most.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I\u2019ll use the aforementioned example to introduce you to the concepts of graph databases. I\u2019ll compare how to solve this problem with a relational database and how a graph database makes it easier. I\u2019ll show you how to query and modify your graph. And, as no talk would be complete without a live demo, I\u2019ll do it all using a real-time procedurally generated random dungeon (I am a dungeon master after all).\r\n\r\nSo come, have a flagon of mead as you learn about graph databases, optimize your dungeon crawl, and equip another weapon in your quest for better software!\"\r\n",

And they have thousands of reports.\r\n\r\nI want to explore this delightful data but, unfortunately, it\u2019s been made for the convenience of humans and not computers. While this makes it easy for me to read, searching for reports can be a bit of a challenge. Some of the data is tidy and computer friendly\u2014like the latitude and longitude. Other bits are really for us humans\u2014like the eyewitness accounts. So, how can I find the Bigfoot sightings that interest me most with data structured like this?\r\n\r\nWell, I\u2019ll show you! In this talk, I\u2019ll load these Bigfoot sightings into Redis and use RediSearch to index them, making it easy to query both the computer friendly bits and the human friendly bits. I\u2019ll also show you how to search on fields, find keywords within text, find nearby Bigfoot sightings using geolocation data, and run queries that aggregate these searches.\r\n\r\nWhen we\u2019re done, you\u2019ll know how to quickly search, query, and aggregate data in Redis using RediSearch.

        "SessionDescription":"During the last decades a growing trend has been to put more and more functionality into the client by using the latest and greatest JavaScript framework. But what if we could be using native code in the browser in order to run computations faster and potentially reuse code from the backend in the frontend. \r\n\r\nEnter Web Assembly. Web assembly is a new web standard which enables you to run native code as part of your current JavaScript framework. This talk will give you a thorough understanding of what web assembly is and how you can use it in your project. \r\n\r\nWe will cover a practical example writing our web assembly using Rust. We will go through everything from writing your web assembly code to publish it as a npm package and finally use it in an existing web application.\r\n\r\n",
