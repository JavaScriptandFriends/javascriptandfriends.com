## Code of Conduct

Welcome to the JS&Friends Code of Conduct. This Code of Conduct is a set of guidelines,
essentially, about what kinds of behavior will not be tolerated within spaces related
to JS&Friends. We have a Code of Conduct because it is necessary, and because it is part
of our effort to create a safe and harassment-free conference experience. Those violating
this Code of Conduct may be warned or even asked to leave the event.

### Who and what is bound by this Code of Conduct?

Everyone involved with JS&Friends is expected to adhere to this Code of Conduct.
This includes, but isn’t limited to, attendees, volunteers, vendors, guests. The
Code of Conduct applies to both online and in-person communication, and includes,
for example, things like slides, emails, forums, booths, stickers, clothing, social
media, and recorded talks. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned
or expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the JS&Friends organizing committee.

### Weapons Policy

No weapons are allowed at conference venues, including but not limited to explosives
(including fireworks), guns, and large knives such as those used for hunting or display,
as well as any other item used for the purpose of causing injury or harm to others.

Anyone seen in possession of one of these items will be asked to leave immediately
and will only be allowed to return without the weapon.

### No-Alcohol Policy

We expect all to comply with No-Alcohol policy at conference venue or workshop.
Attendees are further expected to comply with all state and local laws on this matter.

### COVID19 Policy

For the safety of everyone at the conference, we expect all to maintain social distancing at all times and practice self hygiene.

We expect all to adhere with health policies enforced by the venue and local health authorities. While we do not enforce a mask mandate, Individuals who prefer to wear masks are encouraged to do so. 
Wearing masks is a personal choice and we want everyone to be treated equally with respect.

All participants, speakers, sponsors and staff should refrain themselves from attending the conference if they exhibit COVID19 symptoms.

In case of exhibiting COVID19 symptoms, we strongly suggest them to get tested and consult their doctor and share the results with conference organizing team
if tested positive by reporting to <a href="mailto:report@javascriptandfriends.com">report@javascriptandfriends.com</a>. 

Conference team will notify all participants, speakers, sponsors and staff of the same. 

Please check the below link for details on saftey implementations at the venue.

This code of conduct is applicable to all conference attendees, venue staff,
volunteers, sponsors staff, speakers and organizers.

### What is unacceptable behavior?

Those involved with JS&Friends are expected to comply with both the letter and
the spirit of this Code of Conduct, and are expected to contribute to the creation
and maintenance of a harassment-free space.

Harassment includes:

- Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion.
- Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, technology, level of experience, career, career stage, and employment.
- Deliberate misgendering or use of ‘dead’ or rejected names.
- Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour in spaces where they’re not appropriate.
- Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like “_hug_” or “_backrub_”) without consent or after a request to stop.
- Violence or threats of violence.
- Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm.
- Deliberate intimidation.
- Stalking or following.
- Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes.
- Sustained disruption of discussion.
- Unwelcome sexual attention.
- Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others
- Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease.
- Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse.
- Publication of non-harassing private communication.

Danger is not the same as discomfort. JS&Friends prioritizes marginalized
people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. JS&Friends reserves the right
not to act on complaints regarding:

- ‘Reverse’ -isms, including ‘reverse racism,’ ‘reverse sexism,’ and ‘cisphobia’
- Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you”
- Communicating in a ‘tone’ you don’t find congenial
- Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions

### What if someone breaks the Code of Conduct?

If you are being harassed, or if you notice that someone else is being harassed,
or if you have any other concerns, please contact the JS&Friends organizers. If
the person who is harassing you is on the team, they will recuse themselves from
handling your incident. We will respond as promptly as we can. If a participant
asks you to cease a harassing behavior, do so immediately and respectfully.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, JS&Friends may take any action
they deem appropriate, up to and including permanent expulsion from all JS&Friends
spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser to other JS&Friends
members or the general public.

### How do I report violations?

JS&Friends organizers are available via email at
<a href="mailto:report@javascriptandfriends.com">report@javascriptandfriends.com</a>.
During the conference, we will be wearing something identifiable, likely a name
tag or a t-shirt. We will respond as quickly as we can.

When you report a violation of the Code of Conduct, we pledge to ensure your
privacy during the report, we pledge to keep both the reporters’ and the victims’
information confidential (unless you explicitly agree otherwise). We pledge, if
appropriate, to help you escalate the report to the applicable authorities, such
as venue management, law enforcement, etc.

At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received
harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe
that doing so will increase the safety of JS&Friends participants the general
public. Additionally, in order to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we
reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith.
