We are a new volunteer-run developer conference coming to the Columbus, OH area with a focus on JavaScript based technologies. 
It's called the JavaScript and Friends Conference, and it's landing in the Columbus area on Friday, August 2, 2019! 
Our mission is to bring together a diverse group of around 200 JavaScript developers and friends to learn new skills and concepts 
and to network and develop new relationships. With this conference, we want to contribute to the cultivation of a welcoming, inclusive, 
and dynamic tech scene throughout the mid-west and beyond.

Here's your chance to contribute to that mission! We're looking for the best companies to partner with us and help to make the 
First Annual JavaScript and Friends Conference a success. And with your contribution, it will be! 

Our team has created opportunities for sponsorship at a number of levels to make it easier for you to support our team of volunteers
in bringing this about.

### Where is my money going?

  Proceeds from JS&Friends will be used to help cultivate the developer community in the Midwestern United States and beyond.
  Since this is our first year, this could mean putting the money into expanded speaker and attendee benefits and outreach for next year.
  It could mean helping aspiring programmers through bootcamp scholarships.
  It could mean sponsoring local Meetup groups around JavaScript and related technologies.
  We’re excited about the possibilities, and we welcome your input!

  None of these sponsorship tiers fit your needs? Have more questions? Reach out to the Sponsorship team at <a href="mailto:sponsor@javascriptandfriends.com">sponsor@javascriptandfriends.com</a>. 

  We can work together to come up with a custom sponsorship package that will work for you!
