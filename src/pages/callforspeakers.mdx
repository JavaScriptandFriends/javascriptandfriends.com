 ## Call for Speakers

 ### Important Info!

 All submissions and applicants are expected to abide by our Code of Conduct.
 Please read this Call for Proposals thoroughly. Please don’t hesitate to ask questions!

 ### Who Should Apply?

 You! We welcome speakers of all experience levels and backgrounds.
 Your technical AND non-technical experience is valuable to the community!
 There is no limit on the number of proposals you can submit.

 ### Format

 Sessions: 50 minutes in length
 
 Workshops: If you are interested in giving a workshop, please contact us directly at info@javascriptandfriends.com

 ### Themes and Levels of Expertise

 We are looking for talks at all experience levels.

 Technical Skills: Your talk doesn’t have to relate to JavaScript, but it’s more likely to be accepted if it does.
 That said, use your imagination! We are a diverse group with diverse interests!

 Professional/Human Skills: Sometimes called “soft skills,” these talks don’t need to be related to JavaScript at all.
 We look to these talks to help us become better communicators, contributors, mentors, and general humans.

 Rather than specifying themes, we’d like to share what we hope your talk would do for the audience.

 Your talk could:
  * Help solve a common challenge or sharpen our skills
  * Alert us to new or neglected challenges
  * Present us with new, important information
  * Make our daily lives easier
  * Help us achieve better work/life balance
  * Encourage or guide new developers
  * Show experienced professionals how to lift up new and aspiring developers
  * Demonstrate something unique or entertaining

 ### Financial Assistance

 In order to keep admission prices as low as possible for our first year, we strongly encourage speakers
 to ask for travel assistance from employers. However, we acknowledge that this often results in a far less
 diverse group of speakers.

 If you will be unable to travel to and attend JS&Friends Conf without financial assistance,
 please contact info@javascriptandfriends.com.

 If you or your company would like to sponsor a speaker’s travel, we have a sponsorship level for that!
 Contact info@javascriptandfriends.com for more info!

### New Speakers!

Welcome to speaking! If you are looking for some written guidance, CodeMash offers excellent advice
in their Call for Speakers.

We specifically recommend the section entitled “How to write a good submission.”
