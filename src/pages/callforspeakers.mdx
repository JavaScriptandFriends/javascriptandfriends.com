## Call for Speakers

### Important Info!

All submissions and applicants are expected to abide by our Code of Conduct.
Please read this Call for Proposals thoroughly. Please don’t hesitate to ask questions!

### Who Should Apply?

You! We welcome speakers of all experience levels and backgrounds.
Your technical AND non-technical experience is valuable to the community!
As a speaker you can submit maximum of four proposals.

### Format

We have two options available for speakers to submit proposals for: 

<Text my={20}>Workshops (Day 1): 4 hr duration in length, focused on hands on instruction in a classroom style setting.</Text>

<Text my={20}>Sessions (Day 2): 50 minutes in length, standard presentation format.</Text>

### Themes and Levels of Expertise

We are looking for talks at all experience levels.

Technical Skills: Your talk doesn’t have to relate to JavaScript, but it’s more likely to be accepted if it does.
That said, use your imagination! We are a diverse group with diverse interests!

Professional/Human Skills: Sometimes called “soft skills,” these talks don’t need to be related to JavaScript at all.
We look to these talks to help us become better communicators, contributors, mentors, and general humans.

Rather than specifying themes, we’d like to share what we hope your talk would do for the audience.

Your talk could:

- Help solve a common challenge or sharpen our skills
- Alert us to new or neglected challenges
- Present us with new, important information
- Make our daily lives easier
- Help us achieve better work/life balance
- Encourage or guide new developers
- Show experienced professionals how to lift up new and aspiring developers
- Demonstrate something unique or entertaining

### Financial Assistance

to ask for travel assistance from employers. However, we acknowledge that this often results in a far less
diverse group of speakers.

please contact <a href="mailto:cfp@javascriptandfriends.com">cfp@javascriptandfriends.com</a>.
