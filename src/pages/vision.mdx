  ## JavaScript and Friends - Vision

  ### Who are we?
  The JavaScript and Friends Conference (JS&Friends) is a not-for-profit conference, organized by a team of volunteers.
  We are all active or aspiring software professionals, and we are excited to bring together a diverse group of JavaScript enthusiasts
  and friends to learn and network. With this conference, we want to contribute to the cultivation of a welcoming, inclusive, and
  dynamic tech scene throughout the midwestern United States, and beyond!

  ### Who should attend?

  JS&Friends is for everyone. If you are interested in JavaScript or topics related to JavasScript, this conference is for you!
  Whether you are a seasoned professional, a bootcamp or college student, a self-taught dev, or anywhere in between,
  this conference is for you!

  ### Where is my money going?

  Proceeds from JS&Friends will be used to help cultivate the developer community in the Midwestern United States and beyond.
  Since this is our first year, this could mean putting the money into expanded speaker and attendee benefits and outreach for next year.
  It could mean helping aspiring programmers through bootcamp scholarships.
  It could mean sponsoring local Meetup groups around JavaScript and related technologies.
  We’re excited about the possibilities, and we welcome your input!
