Was the grass greener? Yes\, it was. This talk will cover at a high level what Cypress is\, what it offers and who is likely to use it. Then we\’ll dive into built-in features that make Cypress so awesome to use. We will also discuss common challenges faced when creating and implementing an end-to-end test suite. This includes test structuring\, dealing with authentication\, timing issues and more. A demo repo to get started in Cypress testing will be provided." }}

To set the stage we will build a progressive web app (PWA) from scratch letting you direct key aspects of the application. When done\, you will have the app to play with on your device. From there we will go under the covers and show you how the code was generated and then demonstrate how to expand the project with some custom javascript.  We promise we will keep it fun and engaging." }}
