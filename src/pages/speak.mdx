## Call for Speakers

### Important Info!

All submissions and applicants are expected to abide by our <Link to="/codeofconduct">Code of Conduct</Link>.
Please read this Call for Proposals thoroughly. Please don’t hesitate to ask questions!

### Who Should Apply?

You! We welcome speakers of all experience levels and backgrounds.
Your technical AND non-technical experience is valuable to the community!
There is no limit on the number of proposals you can submit.

We are prioritizing first-time conference speakers this year. It's our first time to plan a conference, so let it be your first time to speak!

### Format

Sessions: 25 minutes long, with no Q&A after. Be sure to let the audience know during your talk if you will be available at another time that day to answer questions!

Workshops: If you are interested in giving a workshop, please contact us via <a href="mailto:jc+magnoliajs@jchiatt.com">jc+magnoliajs@jchiatt.com</a>

### Themes and Levels of Expertise

We are looking for talks at all experience levels.

Technical Skills: Your talk doesn’t have to relate to JavaScript, but it’s more likely to be accepted if it does.
That said, use your imagination! We are a diverse group with diverse interests!

Professional/Human Skills: Sometimes called “soft skills,” these talks don’t need to be related to JavaScript at all.
We look to these talks to help us become better communicators, contributors, mentors, and general humans.

The theme of this year's conference is **"how coding can change your life"**. We are especially excited to accept talks like this. Do you have a good story? Come tell it!

Your talk could:

- Help solve a common challenge or sharpen our skills
- Alert us to new or neglected challenges
- Present us with new, important information
- Make our daily lives easier
- Help us achieve better work/life balance
- Encourage or guide new developers
- Show experienced professionals how to lift up new and aspiring developers
- Demonstrate something unique or entertaining

1.  You submit a completed application by 03/15/2019 (required)

### Speaker Perks & Accommodations

Speakers will receive a free admission to MagnoliaJS.

If you have any special needs or circumstances we should know about, please contact us as early as possible,
but no later than 04/10/2019! A special need might include (but certainly isn’t limited to)
an extra ticket for a spouse or caregiver, wheelchair access, reserved seating, ramps, etc.
Please contact us at <a href="mailto:jc+magnoliajs@jchiatt.com">jc+magnoliajs@jchiatt.com</a>.

### Financial Assistance

Since we only had 10 weeks to plan this conference, funds are extremely tight.
In order to keep admission prices as low as possible for our first year, we strongly encourage speakers
to ask for travel assistance from employers. However, we acknowledge that this often results in a far less
diverse group of speakers.

If you will be unable to travel to and attend MagnoliaJS without financial assistance,
please contact <a href="mailto:jc+magnoliajs@jchiatt.com">jc+magnoliajs@jchiatt.com</a>.

If you or your company would like to sponsor a speaker’s travel, we have a sponsorship level for that!
Contact <a href="mailto:jc+magnoliajssponsor@jchiatt.com">jc+magnoliajssponsor@jchiatt.com</a> for more info!
